This is not quite a one armed bandit, but the closest I could get in a Gradio space üòÅ.

It's running one of the OLMo fine-tunes at the moment. I'll switch that to Wihtgar when I release the model. I made a version where each reel was different, with random combos, but the universe kept picking badgers a bit too often, even for me. Claude lazily added a massive list of combinations instead. This should really live in a separate file, along with the configuration settings, but it works.
