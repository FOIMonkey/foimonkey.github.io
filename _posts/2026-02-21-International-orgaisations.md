Financial institutions are required to screen for Politically Exposed Persons, which extends to senior figures in international organisations that meet the [FATF](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/home.html) definition.

[confirmordeny](https://github.com/confirmordeny) has been quietly building a dataset of what those organisations actually are, after being unable to find one. [SupraVerden](https://github.com/confirmordeny/supraverden) is a dataset of curated lists of international organisations that have privileges and immunities. It's still a work in progress, but there is already a lot of useful data there.

I thought it deserved a front end to make it easier to browse, so I made a basic one - [supraverden.pages.dev](https://supraverden.pages.dev/).

At the moment it covers **557 organisations** grouped into **38 organisation families** and each organisation has its own detail page. 

I found it interesting that 246 organisations sit outside of any specific grouping - there is a much wider variety of treaty-based and multilateral bodies than I had realised.
