I've continued working on guidance pages. I looked into some existing themes for the generator I'm using, but most had too many dependencies for my liking. I don't really want to faff with node or tailwind for something this simple. I am happy with how it looks now, and it passes all the accessibility checks.

I know I said that exemption-specific guidance was for phase 2, but seeing as I was done with my tasks for the sprint already, I've written very basic guides for every FOISA exemption. They're deliberately quite short, and limited to what each exemption covers, whether the public interest test applies, and what to do if it's used against you. I will flesh these out over time with examples etc, but it's nice to have something succinct at this stage.

Outside of that, I have playing with the new [DeepThink in Gemini 3](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-deep-think/). It got 84.6% on ARC-AGI-2, but I know what you're thinking - can it one shot an interactive dancing badger?

Yes it can!

This might seem simple, but the stripes and nose shape have proved too challenging for other models up until now. A brave new world.
