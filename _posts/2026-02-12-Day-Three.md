I'm making steady progress. I've got everything talking to Cloudflare and a holding page up. Pushing to the repo now triggers a build and deploys to the dev site, which is a step up from "it works on my laptop". Touch wood, it’s been more straightforward than I expected so far.

Content-wise, the bones of the first 5 guides are now written. I'm most happy with the basic one page your rights guide. I'm going to get it translated into common community languages, and it's designed to be printed and available to anyone that might need it. Eventually there'll be something for all the exemptions and a decent template, but that's for phase 2.

I've created a draft template for the dataset section that makes it not look like a massive table, and that works well on mobile. I haven't really messed about with CSS for over a decade, so it has felt good to blow off the cobwebs. I hate being trapped in horizontal scroll hell and turning to cards has solved that, though not without some trade-offs that require a bit more thought.

Accessibility-wise, Lighthouse is returning 100 for web and mobile at the moment, which feels like a good sign, though manual checks will be needed.
